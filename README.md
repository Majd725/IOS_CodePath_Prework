## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1) IBM Verify
   - Best Design in my opinion.
   - Very smooth transitions (Like butter ;) ).
2) Paypal
   - Allows you to track packages automatically when using Paypal to purchase.
   - So many monetary features for an app like this.
3) Apple Journal
   - Integration is so nice and convienent for example with Siri.
   - Perfect Design.
   - Only shows the important stuff and actually allows you to do what Apple wanted: Journaling.
   - In my opinion one of the best apps Apple has done.

My App:

In my college we have a swap shop where people donate stuff they dont wnat like clothes and other stuff and any person can come get it. It not only gives people stuff for
free but also helps with recycling.

I want to make an app that shows you what the swapshop currently has instead of going there physically. To update the inventory, when people drop stuff off, they can add it themselves
with photos and a description. 

You can claim and reserve items and the inventory would update automatically. They are also spread into categories so you can turn notification for when new books get
added for example.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had to just adjust to coding an app rather than just to a script. I found out that swift has what I understood to be "just incase" errors where it wont let you build until you have
a backup plan which I did using ??.

I also had hard time searching between SwiftUI and Storyboard but eventually figured it out.
